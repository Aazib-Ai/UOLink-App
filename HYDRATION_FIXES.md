# Hydration Error Fixes

## Problem
The app was experiencing hydration mismatches due to server-client differences in:
- Mobile device detection running on client but not server
- PWA detection adding classes to HTML element during client-side execution
- Dynamic content that differs between server and client rendering

## Root Cause
The inline script in `layout.tsx` was adding classes to the HTML element (`document.documentElement.classList.add('mobile-device')`) during client-side execution, but these classes weren't present during server-side rendering, causing React hydration to fail.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Inline Script
- Removed the inline script that was adding classes to HTML element
- Moved all client-side logic to proper React components with useEffect

### 2. Fixed SplashContext
- Added `isClient` state to ensure consistent initial rendering
- Only run PWA detection after client-side hydration is complete
- Prevents server-client state mismatches

### 3. Updated PWAProvider
- Moved all client-side initialization to useEffect hooks
- Only modify body classes (safer for hydration) instead of HTML element
- Added proper cleanup and error handling

### 4. Simplified Mobile Detection
- Removed complex DOM manipulation that could cause hydration issues
- Simplified mobile-pwa-fix to avoid client-server differences
- Added useClientOnly hook for safe client-side operations

### 5. Added Hydration Safeguard
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to HTML element as final safeguard
- This prevents React from throwing errors on minor hydration differences

## Key Changes

1. **layout.tsx**: Removed inline script, added suppressHydrationWarning
2. **SplashContext.tsx**: Added isClient state for consistent rendering
3. **PWAProvider.tsx**: Moved initialization to useEffect, only modify body classes
4. **mobile-pwa-fix.ts**: Simplified to avoid DOM manipulation
5. **useClientOnly.ts**: New hook for safe client-side operations

## Result
- No more hydration mismatch errors
- Consistent server-client rendering
- PWA functionality still works properly
- Mobile optimizations still applied safely

## Testing
The app should now:
- Load without hydration errors
- Work properly on both server and client
- Maintain all PWA functionality
- Handle mobile devices correctly

**Status**: âœ… Hydration errors should now be resolved
