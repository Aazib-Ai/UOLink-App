# Personalized Notes Feed Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a smart, personalized notes feed that shows users the most relevant content based on their profile and preferences.

## How It Works

### 1. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
Each note gets a relevance score based on:

**High Priority Matches (150+ points)**
- Same major as user (150 pts)
- Same semester (100 pts) 
- Same section (80 pts)

**Medium Priority (20-50 points)**
- High credibility score (up to 100 pts)
- Recent uploads (30 pts for <7 days, 15 pts for <30 days)
- Popular content (25 pts for >10 engagements, 10 pts for >5)

### 2. Fallback Strategy
When there aren't enough personalized notes (< 9):
1. Fill remaining slots with high-credibility recent notes
2. Maintain quality by prioritizing engagement metrics
3. Ensure users always see content

### 3. Filter Integration
- Personalized scoring works with existing filters
- Filters narrow the pool, then personalization ranks results
- Maintains familiar UX while adding intelligence

## Key Features

### Smart Feed Modes
- **"For You"**: Personalized based on user profile
- **"Trending"**: Traditional credibility + recency sorting
- Seamless switching between modes

### Progressive Enhancement
- Works without breaking existing functionality
- Falls back gracefully for users without complete profiles
- Maintains performance with efficient queries

### Transparency
- Shows match reasons (same major, recent, popular, etc.)
- Users understand why they're seeing specific content
- Builds trust in the recommendation system

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. Improved Discovery
- Students find relevant notes faster
- Reduces time spent filtering manually
- Increases engagement with quality content

### 2. Quality Promotion
- High-credibility notes get better visibility
- Encourages users to upload quality content
- Creates positive feedback loop

### 3. User Retention
- Personalized experience keeps users engaged
- Reduces bounce rate from irrelevant content
- Builds habit of checking the feed regularly

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### 1. Cold Start Problem
**Issue**: New users or users with incomplete profiles get poor recommendations

**Solutions**:
- Require profile completion for personalized feed
- Show trending feed as default for incomplete profiles
- Gradual personalization as profile data improves
- Use implicit signals (viewed/saved notes) to infer preferences

### 2. Filter Bubble Effect
**Issue**: Users might miss important content outside their immediate context

**Solutions**:
- Include 20-30% "discovery" content from other majors/semesters
- Boost highly-credible content regardless of match
- Show trending content in mixed feed
- Allow easy switching to general feed

### 3. Performance Concerns
**Issue**: Scoring algorithm might slow down queries

**Solutions**:
- Fetch larger batches (4x page size) for better selection
- Cache user profiles to avoid repeated lookups
- Use Firestore compound indexes for common filter combinations
- Consider background pre-computation for heavy users

### 4. Data Sparsity
**Issue**: Not enough notes for specific major/semester combinations

**Solutions**:
- Expand matching criteria (related majors, adjacent semesters)
- Include notes from senior students in same major
- Show popular notes from similar programs
- Graceful degradation to general feed

### 5. Gaming/Manipulation
**Issue**: Users might try to game the system

**Solutions**:
- Credibility score includes downvotes and reports (negative weight)
- Multiple factors prevent single-metric gaming
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Rate limiting on votes/saves

## Database Optimization

### Recommended Indexes
```javascript
// Compound indexes for common queries
notes: [
  ['semester', 'uploadedAt'],
  ['contributorMajor', 'uploadedAt'], 
  ['subject', 'semester', 'uploadedAt'],
  ['section', 'semester', 'uploadedAt'],
  ['materialType', 'semester', 'uploadedAt']
]
```

### Query Strategy
1. Use filters to narrow dataset (leverage indexes)
2. Fetch 3-4x desired results for scoring
3. Score and sort in memory (fast for small datasets)
4. Return top results

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Machine Learning
- Learn from user interactions (clicks, saves, time spent)
- Collaborative filtering (users with similar profiles)
- Content-based recommendations (subject similarity)

### 2. Advanced Personalization
- Time-based preferences (exam periods, assignment deadlines)
- Social signals (friends' activity, popular in network)
- Learning path recommendations (prerequisite subjects)

### 3. Analytics & Insights
- Track recommendation effectiveness
- A/B test different scoring algorithms
- User feedback on recommendation quality

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```typescript
// In your dashboard component
import { usePersonalizedFeed } from '@/hooks/usePersonalizedFeed';

const { notes, loading, loadMore, isPersonalized } = usePersonalizedFeed({
  pageSize: 9,
  autoLoad: true
});
```

### With Filters
```typescript
const personalizedFeed = usePersonalizedFeed({
  filters: {
    semester: '6',
    subject: 'computer science',
    materialType: 'assignment'
  }
});
```

### Mode Switching
```typescript
const [mode, setMode] = useState('personalized');
const feed = mode === 'personalized' ? personalizedFeed : generalFeed;
```

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Engagement Rate**: Clicks/views on personalized vs general feed
- **Session Duration**: Time spent browsing personalized content
- **Conversion Rate**: Downloads/saves from recommendations
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on recommendation quality
- **Coverage**: % of users getting personalized recommendations

### Performance Metrics
- **Query Time**: Average time for personalized queries
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Profile and note data caching effectiveness
- **Error Rate**: Failed personalization attempts
- **Fallback Rate**: How often system falls back to general feed

This implementation provides a solid foundation for personalized content discovery while maintaining system reliability and user experience quality.
