# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for improving the mobile camera capture system to create a professional, mobile-optimized MVP. The current implementation has edge detection issues on mobile devices and needs enhanced manual cropping capabilities and improved filters for better user experience.

## Glossary

- **Camera_System**: The mobile camera capture interface that allows users to scan documents
- **Edge_Detection**: Automatic document boundary detection using OpenCV (currently problematic on mobile)
- **Manual_Cropping**: User-controlled cropping interface with precise corner adjustment
- **Image_Enhancement**: OpenCV-based processing for blur reduction and quality improvement
- **Filter_System**: Post-processing filters for document optimization (contrast, brightness, etc.)
- **Mobile_Viewport**: Screen dimensions and touch interactions optimized for mobile devices

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to capture documents without automatic edge detection interfering, so that I can reliably scan documents on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the camera scanner on mobile, THE Camera_System SHALL disable automatic edge detection
2. WHILE capturing images on mobile devices, THE Camera_System SHALL maintain OpenCV image enhancement for blur reduction
3. THE Camera_System SHALL provide visual feedback during image capture without edge detection overlays
4. IF edge detection fails on mobile, THEN THE Camera_System SHALL continue with manual processing workflow
5. WHERE mobile device is detected, THE Camera_System SHALL use simplified capture mode without live detection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user editing captured images, I want precise manual cropping controls, so that I can accurately adjust document boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters edit mode, THE Camera_System SHALL display manual cropping interface with corner handles
2. THE Manual_Cropping SHALL allow users to drag individual corner points for precise boundary adjustment
3. WHILE adjusting crop boundaries, THE Manual_Cropping SHALL provide real-time preview of cropped area
4. THE Manual_Cropping SHALL support touch gestures for mobile optimization
5. WHEN crop adjustments are complete, THE Manual_Cropping SHALL apply perspective correction to the selected area

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user processing scanned documents, I want professional-quality filters, so that my documents are clear and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Filter_System SHALL provide enhanced contrast filter for document clarity
2. THE Filter_System SHALL include brightness adjustment for poorly lit captures
3. THE Filter_System SHALL offer grayscale conversion for text documents
4. THE Filter_System SHALL include sharpening filter for text enhancement
5. WHEN filters are applied, THE Filter_System SHALL maintain original image quality without degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want an optimized interface for document scanning, so that I can efficiently capture and edit documents on my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Mobile_Viewport SHALL display camera controls optimized for touch interaction
2. THE Mobile_Viewport SHALL provide adequate button sizes for finger navigation
3. WHILE in portrait mode, THE Mobile_Viewport SHALL optimize layout for single-hand operation
4. THE Mobile_Viewport SHALL include haptic feedback for capture actions where supported
5. WHEN switching between capture and edit modes, THE Mobile_Viewport SHALL maintain smooth transitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with varying lighting conditions, I want enhanced image processing, so that my scanned documents are consistently high quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Image_Enhancement SHALL apply automatic exposure correction for underexposed images
2. THE Image_Enhancement SHALL reduce motion blur using OpenCV stabilization
3. WHILE processing images, THE Image_Enhancement SHALL preserve text readability
4. THE Image_Enhancement SHALL handle various lighting conditions without user intervention
5. IF image quality is insufficient, THEN THE Image_Enhancement SHALL provide quality warnings to user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user generating PDFs from scanned documents, I want fast PDF creation without compression delays, so that I can quickly complete my document scanning workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Camera_System SHALL generate PDFs using client-side processing without server compression
2. THE Camera_System SHALL maintain original image quality in PDF output without additional compression
3. WHEN generating PDFs on mobile devices, THE Camera_System SHALL prioritize speed over file size optimization
4. THE Camera_System SHALL provide progress feedback during PDF generation process
5. IF PDF generation fails, THEN THE Camera_System SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
