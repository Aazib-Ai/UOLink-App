# Mobile Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the UOLINK web application for mobile devices, focusing on server-side rendering improvements, performance enhancements for small screens, and network optimization for low internet connections.

## Glossary

- **SSR**: Server-Side Rendering - rendering React components on the server before sending to client
- **CSR**: Client-Side Rendering - rendering React components in the browser
- **LCP**: Largest Contentful Paint - Core Web Vital measuring loading performance
- **FID**: First Input Delay - Core Web Vital measuring interactivity
- **CLS**: Cumulative Layout Shift - Core Web Vital measuring visual stability
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App - web application with native app-like features
- **Critical Path**: Resources required for initial page render
- **Above-the-fold**: Content visible without scrolling
- **Bundle Splitting**: Dividing JavaScript code into smaller chunks for better loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Loading resources only when needed
- **Edge Caching**: Caching content at CDN edge locations
- **Service Worker**: Background script for offline functionality and caching

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Server-Side Rendering Implementation

**User Story:** As a mobile user with slow internet, I want pages to load quickly with content visible immediately, so that I can access study materials without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page, THE System SHALL render the initial HTML on the server with complete content
2. THE System SHALL achieve LCP scores below 2.5 seconds on 3G connections
3. THE System SHALL provide fallback CSR for interactive components that require client-side state
4. THE System SHALL maintain SEO compatibility with server-rendered meta tags and structured data
5. THE System SHALL implement progressive hydration to minimize JavaScript execution blocking

### Requirement 2: Mobile-First Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to load and respond quickly on my device, so that I can efficiently browse and interact with study materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL achieve Core Web Vitals scores in the "Good" range for mobile devices
2. THE System SHALL implement bundle splitting to reduce initial JavaScript payload below 200KB
3. THE System SHALL lazy load non-critical components and images
4. THE System SHALL optimize images for mobile viewports with responsive sizing
5. THE System SHALL implement virtual scrolling for large lists of notes

### Requirement 3: Network Optimization for Low Bandwidth

**User Story:** As a user with limited internet connectivity, I want the application to work efficiently on slow networks, so that I can access content without excessive loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL implement aggressive caching strategies for static assets
2. THE System SHALL compress all text-based resources using Brotli or Gzip
3. THE System SHALL implement service worker for offline functionality
4. THE System SHALL prioritize critical resources and defer non-essential loading
5. THE System SHALL implement request deduplication to prevent redundant API calls

### Requirement 4: Mobile User Interface Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the interface to be optimized for touch interaction and small screens, so that I can easily navigate and use all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL implement touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px touch targets)
2. THE System SHALL optimize layouts for portrait and landscape orientations
3. THE System SHALL implement swipe gestures for navigation where appropriate
4. THE System SHALL ensure text remains readable without horizontal scrolling
5. THE System SHALL implement mobile-specific navigation patterns

### Requirement 5: Progressive Web App Features

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want app-like functionality including offline access and home screen installation, so that I can use the platform like a native app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL implement a service worker for offline functionality
2. THE System SHALL provide a web app manifest for home screen installation
3. THE System SHALL cache critical resources for offline viewing
4. THE System SHALL implement background sync for data when connection is restored
5. THE System SHALL provide offline indicators and graceful degradation

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor mobile performance metrics, so that I can identify and resolve performance issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL implement Real User Monitoring (RUM) for Core Web Vitals
2. THE System SHALL track mobile-specific performance metrics
3. THE System SHALL implement error tracking for mobile-specific issues
4. THE System SHALL provide performance budgets and alerts
5. THE System SHALL generate mobile performance reports with actionable insights

### Requirement 7: Adaptive Loading Strategies

**User Story:** As a user on various network conditions, I want the application to adapt its loading behavior based on my connection quality, so that I get the best possible experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL detect network connection quality using Network Information API
2. WHEN connection is slow, THE System SHALL reduce image quality and defer non-critical resources
3. WHEN connection is fast, THE System SHALL preload likely-needed resources
4. THE System SHALL implement adaptive streaming for large files like PDFs
5. THE System SHALL provide manual quality controls for user preference override
