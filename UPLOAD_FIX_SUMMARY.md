# Large File Upload Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Users cannot upload files larger than ~1MB, even though the system is configured for 25MB uploads. This is due to Next.js 15 App Router having stricter default request body size limits.

## Root Cause
Next.js 15 App Router has a default request body size limit that's much smaller than the configured 25MB limit. The request gets rejected before it reaches the upload API route.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **File**: `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
- Added comprehensive error handling for different failure scenarios
- Added logging to help debug upload issues
- Better error messages for size limits, timeouts, and other issues

### 2. Client-Side Improvements
- **File**: `src/features/upload/hooks/useUploadForm.ts`
- Enhanced error handling for specific HTTP status codes (413, 408, 502, 504)
- Added logging to track upload progress and file sizes
- Better error messages for users

### 3. Server Configuration
- **File**: `vercel.json`
- Configured maximum duration for upload API route (60 seconds)
- Optimized for file upload handling

### 4. Environment Configuration
- **Files**: `.env.local`, `.env.local.example`
- Added `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB=25` environment variable
- Made file size limits configurable

### 5. Test Utilities
- **File**: `scripts/test-upload.js`
- Created test script to generate files of different sizes for testing
- Helps verify which file sizes work and which fail

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Generate Test Files
```bash
node scripts/test-upload.js
```

### 2. Test Upload Sizes
Try uploading the generated test files in this order:
1. `test-file-1mb.txt` (should work)
2. `test-file-5mb.txt` (test point)
3. `test-file-10mb.txt` (common failure point)
4. `test-file-15mb.txt` (larger test)
5. `test-file-20mb.txt` (near limit)
6. `test-file-25mb.txt` (at limit)

### 3. Monitor Browser Console
- Open browser developer tools
- Watch for console logs showing file sizes and upload progress
- Check for specific error messages

### 4. Check Server Logs
- Monitor server/deployment logs for upload attempts
- Look for the logging messages added to the API route

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Files up to 25MB should upload successfully
- Clear error messages for files exceeding 25MB
- Better feedback during upload process
- Proper timeout handling for slow connections

## If Issues Persist

The problem might be at the deployment platform level (Vercel, etc.). Additional steps:

1. **Check Deployment Platform Limits**
   - Vercel has body size limits that might need adjustment
   - May need to upgrade plan or configure differently

2. **Alternative Solutions**
   - Implement chunked upload for very large files
   - Use direct-to-storage upload (bypass server)
   - Implement upload progress indicators

3. **Network/Infrastructure Issues**
   - Check CDN/proxy settings
   - Verify no intermediate services are limiting request size

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging
- `src/features/upload/hooks/useUploadForm.ts` - Better client-side error handling
- `vercel.json` - Server configuration for uploads
- `.env.local` - Added upload size configuration
- `scripts/test-upload.js` - Testing utility

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the changes
2. Test with the generated test files
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Adjust configuration based on test results
